              <p>This was the project that was made for the CWIT 2021 Hackathon. Me and 3 others
              built this app that would help new, potential interns find people to potentially room togehter.
            They can use the app to try to reserve a spot in the room where then the owner would screen them.

                <p>My part in this project was to research the data used in the project. I also
                  had made the JSON that would hold the data researched. However one of the things i learned
                while working in the team was how to use visual studeo, how to load the website using the terminal
              in visual studeo and github as well aswhat a JSON is and how to use it. </p>

              the users(including admins) could search for trails via any part of the trail. the users could also have a hiking history
            that kept track of the trails they've hiked.</p>
